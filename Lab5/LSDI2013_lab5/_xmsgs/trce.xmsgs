&quot;<arg fmt="%s" index="1">TS_clock50MHz = PERIOD TIMEGRP &quot;clock50MHz&quot; 20 ns HIGH 50%;</arg>&quot;
 fails the maximum period check for output clock &quot;<arg fmt="%s" index="2">dcmdiv2_1/CLK0_BUF</arg>&quot; from <arg fmt="%s" index="3">DCM</arg> block &quot;<arg fmt="%s" index="4">dcmdiv2_1/DCM_INST</arg>&quot; because the period constraint value (<arg fmt="%d" index="5">40000</arg> ps) exceeds the maximum internal period limit of <arg fmt="%d" index="6">27779</arg> ps.
